## 🎮 **How to Use the Goal-Aware Agent**

### **🚀 Basic Goal Management**

```python
from twin_decision_loop import UnifiedTwinDecisionLoop
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize twin with goals enabled
twin = UnifiedTwinDecisionLoop(enable_goals=True)

# Create a goal
goal_id = twin.create_goal(
    title="Learn Advanced Python",
    description="Master advanced Python concepts and frameworks",
    target_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=8),
    goal_type="learning",
    priority=2,
    impact_areas=["work", "learning"],
    related_apps=["VS Code", "Terminal", "PyCharm"]
)

# Get goal status
status = twin.get_goal_status(goal_id)
print(f"Goal progress: {status['goal']['progress']}%")

# Update milestone progress
twin.update_goal_progress(milestone_id, 75.0, "Completed async programming module")
```

### **🧠 Goal-Aware Conversations**

Your twin now provides strategic, goal-aware responses:

```
You: What should I work on today?

Twin: Based on your active goals, I recommend focusing on your "Learn Advanced Python" 
goal, which has a milestone due in 3 days. You're currently at 65% progress on the 
"Async Programming" milestone. Given your productivity patterns, you typically do 
best with learning between 2-4 PM. I suggest dedicating 2 hours to completing the 
async module, which would put you ahead of schedule.

Current priorities:
• URGENT: Async Programming milestone (due in 3 days)
• Complete Python decorators practice (due next week)
• Start Flask web framework module (priority 2)
```

### **📊 Strategic Planning Features**

```python
# Get strategic recommendations
recommendations = twin.get_strategic_recommendations(goal_id)

# Get daily goal briefing
briefing = twin.get_daily_goal_briefing()

# Check if goals should be mentioned proactively
should_mention, message = twin.should_mention_goals_proactively()
if should_mention:
    print(f"Goal reminder: {message}")

# Link current activity to goals (automatic with observer)
twin.link_current_activity_to_goals()
```
