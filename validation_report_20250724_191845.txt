🎯 SYSTEM READINESS ASSESSMENT
========================================
❌ Memory System
✅ Brain Reasoning
✅ Goal-Aware Agent
❌ Observer Mode
✅ Scheduler + Controller
✅ HITL Approval
✅ Real-World Tools
✅ Memory Streaming

🔑 API & CREDENTIAL STATUS
========================================
OpenAI API Key: ⚠️ Missing
Twilio Credentials: ⚠️ Missing
Gmail Credentials: ⚠️ Missing
Calendar Credentials: ⚠️ Missing

🚀 RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================
⚠️ SYSTEM MOSTLY READY - MINOR FIXES NEEDED
   • Core functionality working
   • Some subsystems need attention
   • Safe to begin UI development
   • Address failed tests when possible

Next Steps:
1. Fix failed subsystems (see details above)
2. Begin UI development in parallel
3. Test with live APIs when credentials available
4. Monitor for any stability issues
