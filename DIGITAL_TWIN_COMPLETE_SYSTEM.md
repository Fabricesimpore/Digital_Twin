## 🎮 **How to Use Your Complete Digital Twin**

### **🚀 Quick Start**

```python
# Initialize the complete system
from twin_decision_loop import UnifiedTwinDecisionLoop

twin = UnifiedTwinDecisionLoop(
    persona_path="persona.yaml",
    enable_observer=True,    # Passive behavior learning
    enable_goals=True        # Strategic goal management
)

# Start observer system for behavior learning
await twin.start_observer_system()

# Create a strategic goal
goal_id = twin.create_goal(
    title="Build AI-Enhanced Productivity System", 
    description="Create intelligent tools for personal productivity",
    target_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=8),
    goal_type="project",
    priority=1
)
```

### **🧠 Intelligent Conversations**

Your twin now provides contextually-aware, strategically-informed responses:

```
You: What should I work on right now?

Twin: I see you're currently using VS Code and have been focused for 32 minutes - 
perfect timing! Based on your active goals, I recommend continuing work on your 
"AI-Enhanced Productivity System" project. You have a milestone due in 3 days 
("Core Algorithm Implementation") and you're at 65% progress.

Your behavioral patterns show you're most productive during afternoon coding 
sessions like this one. I'd suggest working for another 20-30 minutes to complete 
the current task, then taking a short break - you typically maintain focus well 
for about 60 minutes during development work.

🎯 Current Priority: Complete algorithm testing (will advance goal by ~15%)
📊 Context: High focus state, optimal work environment, goal-aligned activity
⏰ Recommendation: Continue current work for 20-30 more minutes
```

### **📊 Strategic Management**

```python
# Get strategic overview
goals = twin.get_active_goals()
briefing = twin.get_daily_goal_briefing()
recommendations = twin.get_strategic_recommendations()

# Update progress (manual or automatic via observer)
twin.update_goal_progress(milestone_id, 85.0, "Algorithm optimization complete")

# Check proactive goal mentions
should_mention, message = twin.should_mention_goals_proactively()
if should_mention:
    print(f"🎯 {message}")
```

### **🔍 Memory and Insight Access**

```python
# Introspect on patterns and learning
insights = twin.brain.introspect_with_memory("How do I handle project deadlines?")

# Get behavioral insights from observer
if twin.observer_manager:
    observer_insights = twin.observer_manager.get_insights()
    
# Access memory statistics
memory_stats = twin.brain.memory_updater.get_update_statistics()
```

### **⚡ Action Execution**

```python
# Process action requests with full context awareness
result = await twin.process(
    "Schedule a project review meeting for next Tuesday at 2pm",
    request_type="action"
)

# The twin will:
# 1. Use goal context to understand which project
# 2. Check behavioral patterns for optimal meeting times
# 3. Access memory of past meeting preferences
# 4. Execute calendar integration
# 5. Learn from the outcome for future scheduling
```
