Current Activity:
‚Ä¢ App: VS Code
‚Ä¢ Window: CLI_TEST_PLAN.md
‚Ä¢ Category: DEVELOPMENT
‚Ä¢ Session Duration: 15 minutes
```

### 6.2 Behavioral Insights

```bash
# Run integrated system test with mock APIs
python test_integrated_system.py
```

### 7.2 Real API Test (Optional)
```bash
# Only run if you have real API credentials configured
python test_realworld_apis.py
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: `OPENAI_API_KEY not found`
```bash
# Solution: Set environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# Or add to .env file
```

**Issue**: `Module not found` errors
```bash
# Solution: Activate environment and install deps
source twin_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Issue**: Observer not working
```bash
# Solution: Check platform compatibility
python -c "import platform; print(platform.system())"
# Observer may have limited functionality on some systems
```

**Issue**: Memory system errors
```bash
# Solution: Clear and reinitialize memory
rm -rf cli_twin_memory/
python twin_cli.py  # Will recreate clean memory
```
