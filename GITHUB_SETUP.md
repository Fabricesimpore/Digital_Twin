```

## 🔐 Authentication Setup

If you need to authenticate with GitHub, you have several options:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` permissions
3. Use your token as the password when prompted

### Option 2: SSH Keys (Most Secure)

```bash
# Generate SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Add to SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard (on macOS)
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add the key to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

# Update remote URL to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Fabricesimpore/Digital_Twin.git
```

## 📊 Verify Setup

After pushing, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check remote connection
git remote -v

# Verify the push was successful
git log --oneline -5

# Check GitHub Actions (visit your repo page)
# https://github.com/Fabricesimpore/Digital_Twin/actions
```

## 🎯 Next Steps After Push

1. **Visit your repository**: https://github.com/Fabricesimpore/Digital_Twin
2. **Check GitHub Actions**: Ensure CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
3. **Update README badges**: Add build status badges if desired
4. **Set up branch protection**: Protect main branch in repo settings
5. **Create release**: Tag v0.8.0 when ready for first release

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

For future development:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Create pull request on GitHub
# Merge after review
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Large File Issues
If you get errors about large files:
```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -size +50M -ls

# Use Git LFS for large files if needed
git lfs track "*.model"
git lfs track "*.pkl"
```

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Clear cached credentials
git config --global --unset user.password

# Or use credential helper
git config --global credential.helper store
```

### Push Rejected
```bash
# If remote has changes, pull first
git pull origin main --rebase

# Then push
git push origin main
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

- ✅ All files in your GitHub repository
- ✅ Green checkmarks on GitHub Actions
- ✅ README.md displaying properly
- ✅ Repository showing as "Public" or "Private" as desired
